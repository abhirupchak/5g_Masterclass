**ITU (International Telecommunication Union)** is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating global telecommunication standards, regulations, and spectrum allocation. It ensures that communication systems worldwide, including telecommunications, radio, and satellite, operate seamlessly and without interference.ITU-R manages radio telecommunication, ITU-T sets technical standards for global telecommunications.

**3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)** is a collaborative initiative that develops globally accepted technical specifications for mobile telecommunications. 3GPP defines system architectures, protocols, and standards for mobile networks and works closely with telecom companies and other stakeholders to drive the evolution of cellular networks.

### Relationship:
- ITU sets high-level guidelines and global frameworks for telecom standards, including spectrum allocation for mobile services.
- 3GPP develops specific technical standards for cellular systems that align with ITUâ€™s regulations and spectrum guidelines.
