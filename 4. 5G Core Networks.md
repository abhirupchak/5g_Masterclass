**Identifiers**

Identifiers are used to uniquely recognize any device or subscription to identify its characteristics such as if device is blacklisted or not or any subscription service is allowed or not.

Types of Identifiers

![typeidentifiers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f4423f4-6d2e-41fb-b5b5-4c4af2da366a)

For devices we have PEIs.

**Subscription Identifiers**

SUPI:

MCC : which country subsciber belongs to
MNC : defines exact operator in the country
MSIN : defines the actual subsciber within operator within the country

SUCI: Concealed version of SUPI, even if someone "listens" to the signal they will not be able to decrypt it since it is encrypted.

**SERVICE BASED ARCHITECTURE IN 5G NR**

## 1. Flexibility
- **Monolithic:** Rigid, difficult to update individual components.
- **Microservices:** Highly flexible, individual services can be updated independently.

## 2. Scalability
- **Monolithic:** Limited scaling; scaling requires duplication of the entire system.
- **Microservices:** Scales easily; each service can be scaled independently.

## 3. Fault Isolation
- **Monolithic:** A failure in one part can bring down the entire system.
- **Microservices:** Faults are isolated to specific services, reducing system-wide impact.

## 4. Deployment
- **Monolithic:** Requires redeploying the entire system for updates.
- **Microservices:** Supports continuous deployment with minimal disruption.

A network function can be considered as a self contained software module.

## 1. What is REST?
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- It uses standard HTTP methods to interact with resources on a server.

## 2. Key HTTP Methods in REST:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server (e.g., fetch user details).
- **POST**: Send data to the server to create a resource (e.g., create a new user).
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server (e.g., update user information).
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., delete a user).

# Service Discovery (NRF)

## 1. What is NRF?
- **NRF (Network Repository Function)** is a key component in 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA).
- It enables **service discovery**, allowing network functions to register and find each other.

## 2. Main Functions:
- **Registration**: Network functions register their services with NRF.
- **Discovery**: NRF provides endpoints of available services to other network functions.
- **Load Balancing**: Helps optimize traffic by directing requests to suitable instances.

## 3. RESTful Interface:
- Uses **HTTP REST** APIs for communication between network functions and NRF.

# Registration Management

## 1. What is Registration Management?
- It's a process in 5G networks for managing **user devices' access** to the network.
- Ensures **authentication** and updates user information like location.

## 2. Key Functions:
- **Registration**: Devices (UEs) register with the network via the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).
- **Location Updates**: Tracks user location for efficient resource allocation.
- **Session Management**: Enables network services based on the user’s subscription and current location.

## 3. Role in 5G:
- Critical for ensuring users are authenticated, reachable, and provided with appropriate services.

# Connection Management

- Deals with how a device gets and keeps a connection with the core network.
- Sets up, maintains, and ends connections.

## Key Parts:
- **Session Setup**: Starts communication between device and network.
- **Session End**: Stops the connection.
- **Mobility**: Keeps the connection while the device moves.

---

# RAN Connection Management

- Manages the connection between the device and the Radio Access Network (RAN).
- Makes sure the radio link is stable.

## Key Parts:
- **Radio Bearers**: Sets up radio links for data to move between device and network.
- **Handover**: Keeps the connection when the device moves to a new tower.
- **Resource Assignment**: Gives the right amount of radio resources for a good connection.

# Mobility Management

- Manages how a device moves around in the network.
- Keeps the connection active as users change locations.

## Key Parts:
- **Tracking**: Monitors where the device is to route calls/data correctly.
- **Location Updates**: Updates the network with the device's new location.
- **Handover Control**: Switches the connection to a new cell/tower when moving.
- **Session Continuity**: Makes sure services keep running smoothly during moves.
