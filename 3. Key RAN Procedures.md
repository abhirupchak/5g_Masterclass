***Initial Access:***

Cell search is the process of the UE finding a nearby cell tower in the corresponding cell, it can be done cellwide or by beamforming in NR. Now the procedure of initial access is explained with the help of following pictures.

The methods in this part eventually lead to the device being in RRC IDLE mode.

**Random Access**

Once device has identified the cell by initial access it can actually access the cell with random access procedure.

***Contention Based Random Access***

This mode is triggered when following cases happen

Summary

After doing either CBRA or CFRA the device ends up in RRC connected mode.
