### The 5G System
**What does 5G improve?**:

**ITU (International Telecommunication Union)** is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating global telecommunication standards, regulations, and spectrum allocation. It ensures that communication systems worldwide, including telecommunications, radio, and satellite, operate seamlessly and without interference.ITU-R manages radio telecommunication, ITU-T sets technical standards for global telecommunications.

**3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)** is a collaborative initiative that develops globally accepted technical specifications for mobile telecommunications. 3GPP defines system architectures, protocols, and standards for mobile networks and works closely with telecom companies and other stakeholders to drive the evolution of cellular networks.

### Relationship:
- ITU sets high-level guidelines and global frameworks for telecom standards, including spectrum allocation for mobile services.
- 3GPP develops specific technical standards for cellular systems that align with ITUâ€™s regulations and spectrum guidelines.

### 5G Use Cases:
1. **Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)**
   - Faster speeds, improved coverage for 4K/8K streaming, AR/VR, cloud gaming. Requires high data rates.

2. **Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)**
   - Supports millions of IoT devices for smart cities, agriculture, logistics. Requires large area coverage and penetration of signal. Low data rates are sufficient.

3. **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC)**
   - Near-zero latency for autonomous driving, remote surgery, and robotics. Requires absolute precision in data transfer with no packet loss or latency and medium data rates.

### 5G Network Components:

**5G Network works as per the following path**:

**UE(User Equipment)-->GNodeB(5G RAN)-->Core Network-->Internet**

![5gnetwork](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-13%20115110.png)

The **user plane** is what is shown to the user while they are utilising the internet service. The **control plane** is the behind-the-scenes work that goes on in the background. The 5G core's functions are divided into each of these two components.

Separating these two components allows us to scale them individually as per use case. For example, mmtc requires more scaling of control signals whereas embb requires scaling of user signals. This also allows us to improve latency by optimizing the deployment of network as per use case requirements.
The N's represents the interfaces by which the components interact with each other.

### Parts of the 5G Core

1. **Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)**
   - Manages user registration, mobility, and authentication.
   - Handles connection setup and mobility management(tracking user location).

2. **Session Management Function (SMF)**
   - Responsible for session establishment, modification, and release.
   - Manages IP address allocation and traffic routing.
   - Connects to the UPF whenever new session starts and ends as per diagram.

3. **User Plane Function (UPF)**
   - Routes and forwards user data.
   - Manages QoS(Quality of Service) and packet filtering.

4. **Policy Control Function (PCF)**
   - Enforces network policies(data and spectrum limitations).
   - Ensures compliance with operator defined policies according to the data plan or wifi subscription.

5. **Unified Data Management (UDM)**
   - Stores and manages subscriber data(SIM card information).
   - Performs authentication, authorization, and subscriber profile management.

6. **Authentication Server Function (AUSF)**
   - Authenticates users and devices connecting to the 5G network.
   - Works closely with UDM to verify user credentials.

### 5G Deployment
Since 4G and 5G exist simultaneously nowadays we have several different ways of deployment that operators can choose:

Option 1 & 2 are either complete 4G deployment or 5G deployment.

EPC-Enhanced Packet Core (4G)

![option1&2](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-13%20124136.png)

Option 3: 4g core network with enodeb as master with 5g as secondary.

![option3](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-13%20124422.png)

3a: data directly sent to the gnodeb, disadvantage is that data cannot be sent to both over same connection. for eMBB gnodeb is utilised, for VoLTE enodeb can be used.

3x: data sent to both gnodeb and enodeb(enhanced node b/enhanced lte ran). 

![4g+5gran](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-12%20191719.png)

Option 4: 5g core network with gnodeb as master with 4g as secondary.

![4a+4x](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-13%20130142.png)

Option 5: 5g core network with enodeb(modified to work with 5g core)

![5](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-13%20130205.png)

Option 6: 4g core network with gnodeb, however this is not supported as per the 5g standardization.

![6](https://github.com/abhirupchak/images-5G_masterclass/blob/main/imagesch1/Screenshot%202024-10-13%20130242.png)

Option 7: Similar to option 3x but enhanced 4g core is replaced by 5g core with enodeb as secondary.
